# Introduction
This repository serves as an introduction to some of the basic activation functions used in neural networks.
Example used will be the network architecture found in the neural_network_from scratch repository.

# Partial derivatives from example
dSSR/db1[Using chain rule] = dSSR/dPredicted * dPredicted/dy1 * dy1/dx1 * dx1/db1 \
dSSR/db2[Using chain rule] = dSSR/dPredicted * dPredicted/dy2 * dy2/dx2 * dx2/db2
